we will use .gitignore generator to generate the code of .gitignore

For not restarting node we will use nodemon, it will automatically restart the server
to Install nodemon we will use command "npm i -D nodemon"


we will controllers and middleware in database which will keep check on who is accessing
its code "mkdir controllers db middleware models routes utils


we will install prettier so that while working in group in there should be no conflict in code
like spacing, anyone left semi colne or commas
command line "npm i -D prettier"
after running this command we need add some files mannualy to use it like .prettierrc,.prettierignore
in .prettierignore we will write names of all files/folders in which we don't want prettier to implement


DATABASE Connection

after this we will do setup on mongoDB ATLAS
Disclamer:- Don't share password
then connect it on .env files
PORT=8000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://aman:<Your password>@cluster0.nhfky3t.mongodb.net
if there is @ in password use %40 in place of @ to decode it



After this install mongoose, express and dotenv in folders
command - "npm i mongoose express dotenv"
we can check in package.json dependencies 

DATABASE IS ALWAYS STORED IN ANOTHER CONTINENT-----> QUOTE
THERE CAN BE MANY ERRORS IN COMMUNICATING WITH DATABASE, TO AVOID IT WE USE ASYNC, FETCH LIKE ";(async()=>{})()"
